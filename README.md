# Smart Water Level Indicator with NodeMCU ESP8266 and Blynk

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a water level indicator system using NodeMCU ESP8266 and the Blynk app for automatic water level control. The system offers both automatic and manual control modes to ensure optimal water usage and prevent overflow or dry running of the pump.

## Key Features
- **Automatic and Manual Control Modes**: Users can switch between automatic and manual modes to control the water pump and buzzer.
- **Component Integration**: Utilizes LTM PC designer software for PCB design and connects components according to the circuit diagram.
- **Control Modes Setup**: Includes configuring control modes for the pump, relay, and buzzer.
- **Mobile Dashboard**: Enables users to control the pump and buzzer through a mobile dashboard using the Blynk app.
- **Code Configuration**: Involves downloading the necessary code and setting up parameters for the water level indicator project.

## Components Used
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Relay Module
- Water Pump
- Buzzer
- PCB (designed using LTM PC designer software)
- Blynk App (for mobile dashboard)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Setup**: Assemble the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. **PCB Design**: Use LTM PC designer software for designing the PCB layout.
3. **Blynk App Configuration**: Set up the Blynk app and create a mobile dashboard for controlling the pump and buzzer.
4. **Code Configuration**: Download and configure the provided Arduino code.
5. **Upload Code**: Upload the code to the NodeMCU ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.

## How to Use
1. **Automatic Mode**: The system automatically controls the water pump based on the water level detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
2. **Manual Mode**: Users can manually control the water pump and buzzer using the Blynk app mobile dashboard.

## Goals
This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for monitoring and controlling water levels, ensuring optimal usage and preventing overflow or dry running of the pump.
